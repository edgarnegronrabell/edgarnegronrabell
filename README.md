### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Edgar NegrÃ³n. I'm a self taught programmer from Puerto Rico. I have a Bachelor's degree in Audiovisual Communications 
				and I'm a film freak. I decided to switch careers in January 2019 and since then have begun my journey to become a programmer. 
				I have studied Front-end languages and frameworks such as HTML, CSS, SASS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Bulma, and Vue.js but I'm also familiar 
				with Back-end languages and frameworks such as NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. Since 2019, I have been working as a Web Developer for 
				the Center for Puerto Rican Studies in Hunter College where I have worked with Drupal, SCSS, Bootstrap Python, Dash and Flask. 
				Earlier this year, I started working on a Full-Stack project implementing the MEVN stack, and improving my skills in Vue.js, Node, Express and Mongo DB.
